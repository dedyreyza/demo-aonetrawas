/* ⚠️ NOT USED - Reference Only
 *
 * This CSS module is NOT imported by villa-slider.tsx
 * The actual CSS for this component is in: styles/libraries.css
 *
 * Component uses Swiper library global styles:
 * - .swiper-slider-group
 * - .swiper-slider-group[data-swiper-slider-type="stay"]
 *
 * These styles are kept global because:
 * 1. Swiper library expects global class names
 * 2. Shared across potential future slider components
 * 3. Complex responsive/animation styles (500+ lines)
 *
 * This file is kept as reference for documentation purposes.
